ðŸ›¡ How I Built Simple 1 Person Startup With 100% AI ðŸ›¡

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how AI enables one-person businesses, allowing anyone to become an entrepreneur or solopreneur. By leveraging AI tools, we can now handle complex tasks that previously required multiple experts. This README guides you through setting up and running an AI-powered e-commerce platform that uses AI for product classification and shipping logistics.

## What's This Project About?

This project is a practical implementation of a one-person startup powered entirely by AI. It includes:

1. A Streamlit-based frontend for an e-commerce website
2. A Flask backend server that communicates with an AI model
3. AI-powered product classification for shipping categories
4. A simple database system for storing product information

The project demonstrates how AI can automate tasks like product categorization, enabling efficient management of an e-commerce platform by a single person.

     ```
   - Activate the environment:
   
     - Windows:
       ```bash
       How_I_Built_Simple_1Person_Startup_W_100_AI\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - Unix/macOS:
       ```bash
       source How_I_Built_Simple_1Person_Startup_W_100_AI/bin/activate
       ```
2. **Install Project Dependencies:**

   - Navigate to your project directory and install required packages using `pip`:
   
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/project
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Setup Groq Key:**
